# Google ChatGPT

A Google Chrome extension that swaps the `I'm Feeling Lucky` button for a ChatGPT button 🤖

No api key required as it redirects to `https://chat.openai.com/chat` and auto submits the prompt ⚡️

If you are looking to make your own extension or have a go modifying this one. I have commented all the code to make it nice and easy to understand / navigate 😁
